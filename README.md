<img width="930" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/504005e2-730e-449d-a918-f4311c6db8b2">

This project is an Android application for image recognition using Google ML Kit. The app allows users to take photos using their device's camera and then uses ML Kit's image labeling feature to identify objects in the photo. It provides an easy and interactive way to explore basic image recognition capabilities directly on a mobile device.

Features

Capture Image from Camera: Users can take a photo using their device's camera directly from within the app.
Image Labeling: Uses Google ML Kit's Image Labeling API to recognize and label objects in the captured photo.
Display Results: The app displays the recognized label of the object on the screen, allowing the user to quickly see the result.

How It Works
Open Camera: Tap the "Capture" button to open the device camera and take a photo.
Image Processing: Once the image is captured, it is processed using Google ML Kit's Image Labeling API.
View Labels: The recognized label is displayed on the screen, providing information about the object in the image.

Technologies Used

Android: Built with Java and Android SDK.
Google ML Kit: Utilizes ML Kitâ€™s Image Labeling API for object recognition.
CameraX API: Handles the camera functionality, allowing the app to capture photos.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Android Studio: Install Android Studio to build and run the project.
Google ML Kit: Ensure that all required dependencies for ML Kit are added to the project.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageRecognitionMLKit.git
Open in Android Studio: Import the project into Android Studio.
Sync Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies are synced.
Run the App: Connect an Android device or start an emulator and run the app.

Permissions
The app requires camera permission to capture images. This permission will be requested when the user first tries to use the camera.

Usage
Launch the app.
Tap the "Capture" button to open the camera.
Take a photo.
Wait for the image processing to complete. The app will display the recognized label of the object.
Screenshots

Future Enhancements
Multiple Object Detection: Enhance the app to recognize multiple objects in a single image.
Offline Mode: Add offline functionality for image labeling without an internet connection.
Enhanced UI: Improve user interface for better experience.
